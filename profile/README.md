# Next talks:
## **April 28**: **Sergey Galkin** (L866): **Pencils of Quadrics**, Hyper-Elliptic Curves, their Jacobians, and Moduli Spaces of Stable Vector Bundles of Rank Two
I will introduce higher-dimensional analogues of pencils of conics (that were introduced by Filipe on April 14) - namely pencils of quadrics. For example, I will explain a classical construction that relates pencils of quadrics with hyper-elliptic curves (double covers of a projective line), and discuss how their linear algebra and geometry is related to various questions about moduli spaces of bundles on these curves, in particular how to construct some forms of Jacobians and moduli spaces of stable rank 2 bundles on a hyper-elliptic curve in terms of a pencil of quadrics and the respective matrix of linear forms (Miles Reid's thesis and Desale-Ramanan's theorem from 1970s).

Just one dimension higher - if we consider pencils of two-dimensional quadrics in a three-dimensional projective space (i.e. 4-times-4 symmetric matrices with entries in homogeneous linear polynomials of two variables) we obtain models of elliptic (genus one) curves, and can also relate it to a version of Poncelet theorem in three-dimensional space. When we consider pencils of 4-dimensional quadrics in 5-dimensional projective space their base locus is an interesting Fano threefold, and the respective spectral curve is a curve of genus two (all of them are hyper-elliptic), with the base locus (Fano threefold) being one of the simplest moduli spaces of vector bundles, and the respective Jacobian of a genus two curve being isomorphic to the variety of lines isotopic with respect to all quadratic forms in the pencil.

This is a somewhat classical geometric topic that easily related to both well-known constructions as well as interesting open problems related to some of my research. So it could be useful to students interested in algebraic geometry or conformal field theory, as well as to those whose research is related to elliptic and genus two curves and their Jacobians, among many others.

## **May 5**, **Victor Ibrahim Santos El Adji**: [Determinantal Varieties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Determinantal_variety)

In this seminar I will dedicate myself to the study of generic determinantal varieties (or simply determinantal varieties), given by complex matrices whose minors of a given order cancel each other out. In addition to being a central topic in both Commutative Algebra and Algebraic Geometry, these varieties have several connections with Invariant Theory, Representation Theory and Combinatorics. For example, many classical constructions such as normal rational curves, Veronese manifolds, Segre manifolds, normal rational rolls, are given by determinant manifolds.

Our aim is to describe the fundamental properties (normality, irreducibility, singular place, etc) and calculate the basic invariants (degree, dimension, Euler's topological characteristic, etc) of determinant manifolds. To do so, we establish the first and second fundamental theorems of invariant theory as one of the main tools

## Previous talk: April 14, **Filipe Bellio da Nóbrega**:   pencils of conics

A __conic__ is an algebraic curve given by the zero set of a homogeneous polynomial of degree two in three variables, as $ax^2+2hxy+by^2+2fxz+2gyz+cz^2$. Such an expression is given by six coefficients, but multiples of a given equation correspond to the same curve. Therefore, the moduli space of __real conics__ and of __complex conics__ are $\mathbf{RP}^5$ and $\mathbf{CP}^5$ respectively.

A __real (complex) pencil of conics__ is a one-parameter family of conics given by a __real (complex) line__ in the suitable moduli space. Let $u$ and $v$ be two distinct conics, the pencil that contains them can be algebraically given by $\alpha u + \beta v$, where $[\alpha \colon \beta] \in \mathbf{RP}^1$ (or $\mathbf{CP}^1$). In this talk we will describe and classify all orbits of pencils of conics under the action of the projective group $\mathrm{PGL}(3,\mathbf{R})$ ( and $\mathrm{PGL}(3,\mathbf{C})$ ).

## April 14: Filipe Bellio da Nóbrega: Pencils of Conics
A __conic__ is an algebraic curve given by the zero set of a homogeneous polynomial of degree two in three variables, as $ax^2+2hxy+by^2+2fxz+2gyz+cz^2$. Such an expression is given by six coefficients, but multiples of a given equation correspond to the same curve. Therefore, the moduli space of __real conics__ and of __complex conics__ are $\mathbf{RP}^5$ and $\mathbf{CP}^5$ respectively.

Let $u$ and $v$ be two distinct conics, the pencil that contains them can be algebraically given by $\alpha u + \beta v$, where $[\alpha \colon \beta] \in \mathbf{RP}^1$ (or $\mathbf{CP}^1$). In this talk we will describe and classify all orbits of pencils of conics under the action of the projective group $\mathrm{PGL}(3,\mathbf{R})$ ( and $\mathrm{PGL}(3,\mathbf{C})$ ).

## March 31: [**Jacques Pienaar**](https://www.jaypienaar.com): [QBism](http://www.physics.umb.edu/Research/QBism/), an introduction for mathematicians

## March 24: **Bruno Suassuna**: Formal Perturbation Theory for Stochastic Paths
- Short abstract for mathematicians:

We discuss methods of perturbative QFT applied to certain stochastic differential equations (SDE), perturbations of the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. No knowledge of SDE or QFT is assumed.

Perturbative QFT amounts to some sort of generating function for formal power series expansions, and these methods have found many applications in pure and applied mathematics. This is the main motivation for this talk. The lack of mathematical proofs often comes together with the magical formulas derived from these methods, and this will also be examplified in this talk. 

The application we discuss was the subject of joint work with Bruno Melo (ETH Zurich) and Thiago Guerreiro (PUC-RIO), published (PhysRevA) in January 2021.

- Fine-print for physicists:

The motivation comes from experiments with optical tweezers, which roughly are laser beams able to trap certain particles around a point of mechanical equilibrium. The particle does not sit in the mechanical equilibrium, but jiggles stochastically around it; this stochasticity is known as Brownian motion and is the reason one uses SDE instead of ODE in the mathematical models. Often the working assumption is that the optical forces are a linear function of the displacement from mechanical equilibrium, which as we know is simply a first order Taylor approximation. We provided a way to deal with optical forces modelled by a linear function perturbed by small non-linearities, so potentially this method would be useful for sufficiently precise experiments. The validity of our method was probed by some numerical experiments, and for mysterious reasons it seems to work.

## 2022, Dec 16: **[Marcos Craizer](http://intranet.mat.puc-rio.br/~craizer/)**: Esferas Afins Impróprias e Equações de Monge-Ampère
Nesta aula vamos falar da relação entre esferas afins impróprias e equações de Monge-Ampère. Discutiremos a construção centro-corda para esferas afins impróprias de dimensão 2 e as singularidades genéricas destas superfícies. Mostramos também uma generalização desta construção para dimensões pares arbitrárias.

## 2022, Dec 9: **[Alexander Guterman](https://math.biu.ac.il/en/node/3469)**: The solution of Wang-Krauters’s problem on permanents of (−1, 1)-matrices
Slides of the talk in PDF: <http://www.mat.puc-rio.br/Upload/Arquivo/2022/12/guterman22decrio.pdf>
The classes of $(-1,1)$-matrices are very important in algebra and combinatorics and in various their applications. For example, well-known Hadamard matrices are of this type.  

Two important functions in matrix theory, determinant and permanent, look very similar:
$$\mathrm{det} A = \sum_{\sigma\in \Sigma_n} (-1)^{\sigma} a_{1\sigma(1)}\cdots a_{n\sigma(n)}$$
and
$$\mathrm{per} A = \sum_{\sigma\in \Sigma_n} a_{1\sigma(1)}\cdots a_{n\sigma(n)}$$
here $A=(a_{ij})\in M_n(\mathrm{F})$ is an $n\times n$ matrix and $\Sigma_n$ denotes the set of all permutations of the set $\{1,\ldots, n\}$. 

While the computation of the determinant can be done in a polynomial time, it is still an open question, if there are such algorithms to compute the permanent. 

In 1974 Wang posed a question to find a decent upper bound for $|\per(A)|$ if $A$ is a square $\pm 1$-matrix of rank $k$.
In 1985 Kräuter conjectured a certain upper bound. 

We prove the Kräuter's conjecture and thus obtain the complete answer to the Wang's question. In particular, we characterized matrices with the maximal possible permanent for each value of $k$.

We also plan to discuss other problems related to permanent for $(0,1)$ and $(-1,1)$-matrices.

The talk is based on the joint work with M.V. Budrevich.
