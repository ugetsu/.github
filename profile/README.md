# Abstracts of all talks      ‚≠£‚≠£‚≠£ add yours below ‚≠£‚≠£‚≠£

## June 30 -- **Andrey Soldatenkov** -- An introduction to [o-minimal structures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O-minimal_theory)

O-minimal structures are collections of subsets in $\mathbb{R}^n$ that have certain finiteness properties
that make them similar to semialgebraic sets. I will start by recalling the definition of the latter and
discussing the Tarski--Seidenberg theorem claiming that a linear projection of a semialgebraic set is again
semialgebraic. Then I will try to give an overview of how one can generalize this and obtain the notion
of an o-minimal structure. I expect that the talk will mostly be informal, since I am not a specialist in
o-minimal structures and got interested in them because of their recent applications to Hodge theory. 

## June 16 -- **Sergei Burkin** -- An introduction to [operads](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operad)

Operads are structures similar to categories. Morphisms in an operad can have any number of inputs and exactly one output. Each operad encodes a type of algebra. Such types include associative algebras, Lie algebras, BV-algebras and other types of algebras appearing in mathematics and physics.

We will discuss some of the main applications and ideas in operad theory, including recognition principle, Koszul duality, formality of little disks and deformation quantization, Grothendieck‚ÄîTeichmuller theory, and theory of homotopy coherent structures.

## June 2 (14:00-16:00, L866) -- **Rodrigo Matos** -- Irreducibility of the Bloch and Fermi varieties on periodic media and connections to spectral theory. (an introduction to [Fermi surface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermi_surface) (Fermi Varieties), Bloch Varieties, and an interface of algebraic geometry, spectral theory and mathematical physics)

The structure of the dispersion relation is one of the central aspects to the study of periodic Schr√∂dinger operators. 

Besides the intrinsic interest from the viewpoint of several complex variables and algebraic geometry, the dispersion relation also carries relevant information for the spectral theory of periodic media. In particular, for the structure of spectral boundaries, isospectrality, and existence of eigenvalues for locally perturbed operators. 

I will discuss some of these connections as well as recent irreducibility theorems for the Bloch and Fermi varieties,
focusing on two joint works with Jake Fillman and Wencai Liu:
- Algebraic Properties of the Fermi Variety for Periodic Graph Operators, [2305.06471](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.06471)
- Irreducibility of the Bloch Variety for Finite-Range Schr√∂dinger Operators, [2107.06447](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.06447)

These recent papers cover a wide class of lattice geometries in arbitrary dimension and verify the discrete version of certain conjectures of Kuchment for various discrete models.


A comment from Sergey: Rodrigo will introduce us to an area at the intersection of algebraic geometry, spectral theory, and mathematical physics. The very same Laurent polynomials appear in the study of [Fermi varieties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermi_surface) of periodic Schr√∂dinger operators, in [mirror symmetry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirror_symmetry_(string_theory)) for [Fano varieties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fano_variety) and [K3 surfaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K3_surface), in Apery's approximation for [zeta(3)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ap%C3%A9ry's_constant), in two-loops diagrams for [Bhabha scattering](https://mathscinet.ams.org/mathscinet-getitem?mr=3951114), and many other places.


## June 2 (9:00-11:00, L856): **Miguel dos Anjos Batista**: [mutually orthogonal latin squares](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutually_orthogonal_Latin_squares), their relation to [finite projective planes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projective_plane#Finite_projective_planes), and all that

I will introduce the concept of a finite projective plane (FPP), their basic structure, and show the existence of some of them. Beside that, I will talk about Mutually Orthogonal Latin Squares (MOLS), a "categorical" way to visualize it and how they interact with FPP. If possible I will talk about more complex FPP existence theorems.


## May 26: **Antonio Vasconcellos** - [random matrices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_matrix), graphs and a combinatorial proof of [Wigner's Semi-Circle Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wigner_semicircle_distribution)

In this seminar, we present a combinatorial proof of
         [Wigner's Semi-Circle Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wigner_semicircle_distribution),
a fundamental result in [random matrix theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_matrix).
It describes the limiting behavior of the eigenvalue distribution of large Gaussian Orthogonal Ensemble (GOE) matrices. While the original proof of the Semi-Circle Law relies on advanced techniques from analysis, our approach provides an alternative perspective through combinatorial methods.


## May 19 (15:30--17:30) [**Graham Andrew Smith**](https://www.ihes.fr/~moriarty) - [Morse homology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morse_homology)

I will present the main ideas underlying Morse homology theory in the finite dimensional case and will discuss some applications and conjectures in the infinite dimensional setting.


## May 12: **Veronika Treumova**: [dessins d'enfant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dessin_d'enfant) (i.e. graphs on surfaces), and their counting

Dessin d‚Äôenfant (child‚Äôs drawing, map) is a graph embedded into a two-dimensional¬†surface. The term was¬†introduced by A.¬†Grothendieck in 1984 in¬†his famous "Esquisse d‚Äôun Programme". The theory of dessins d‚Äôenfants in¬†a beautiful way connects 19th century complex analysis with 20th century¬†arithmetic geometry, and very simple and intuitive¬†objects with very abstract¬†concepts. Besides overview of the topic I will present some results in one specific area, which is enumeration of graphs of a certain type.


## May 5: **Victor Ibrahim Santos El Adji**: [Determinantal Varieties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Determinantal_variety)

I will introduce and study (generic) determinantal varieties: the loci of matrices of rank bounded from above.
In addition to being a central topic in both Commutative Algebra and Algebraic Geometry,
these varieties have several connections with Invariant Theory, Representation Theory and Combinatorics.
For example, many classical constructions such as rational normal curves, Veronese manifolds, Segre manifolds, rational normal scrolls, fall into the class of determinant varieties.

I will describe their fundamental properties (such as normality, irreducibility, singular locus, etc) and calculate their basic invariants (degree, dimension, topological Euler number, etc).
To do so, I will establish the first and the second fundamental theorems of invariant theory as one of the main tools.


## April 28: [**Sergey Galkin**](http://mat.puc-rio.br/~sergey): Pencils of Quadrics, Hyper-Elliptic Curves, their Jacobians, and Moduli Spaces of Stable Vector Bundles of Rank Two
I will introduce higher-dimensional analogues of pencils of conics (introduced by Filipe on April 14) - namely pencils of quadrics, for example I will explain a classical construction that relates pencils of quadrics with hyper-elliptic curves (double covers of a projective line), and discuss how their linear algebra and geometry is related to various questions about moduli spaces of bundles on these curves, in particular how to construct some forms of Jacobians and moduli spaces of stable rank 2 bundles on a hyper-elliptic curve in terms of a pencil of quadrics and the respective matrix of linear forms (Miles Reid's thesis and Desale-Ramanan's theorem).

Just one dimension higher - if we consider pencils of two-dimensional quadrics in a three-dimensional projective space (i.e. 4-times-4 symmetric matrices with entries in homogeneous linear polynomials of two variables) we obtain models of elliptic (genus one) curves, and can also relate it to a version of Poncelet theorem in three-dimensional space. When we consider pencils of 4-dimensional quadrics in 5-dimensional projective space their base locus is an interesting Fano threefold, and the respective spectral curve is a curve of genus two (all of them are hyper-elliptic), with the base locus (Fano threefold) being one of the simplest moduli spaces of vector bundles, and the respective Jacobian of a genus two curve being isomorphic to the variety of lines isotopic with respect to all quadratic forms in the pencil.

This is a somewhat classical geometric topic that easily related to both well-known constructions as well as interesting open problems related to some of my research. So it could be useful to students interested in algebraic geometry or conformal field theory, as well as to those whose research is related to elliptic and genus two curves and their Jacobians, among many others.


## April 14: **Filipe Bellio da N√≥brega**: Pencils of Conics
A __conic__ is an algebraic curve given by the zero set of a homogeneous polynomial of degree two in three variables, as $ax^2+2hxy+by^2+2fxz+2gyz+cz^2$. Such an expression is given by six coefficients, but multiples of a given equation correspond to the same curve. Therefore, the moduli space of __real conics__ and of __complex conics__ are $\mathbf{RP}^5$ and $\mathbf{CP}^5$ respectively.

A __real (complex) pencil of conics__ is a one-parameter family of conics given by a __real (complex) line__ in the suitable moduli space. Let $u$ and $v$ be two distinct conics, the pencil that contains them can be algebraically given by $\alpha u + \beta v$, where $[\alpha \colon \beta] \in \mathbf{RP}^1$ (or $\mathbf{CP}^1$). In this talk we will describe and classify all orbits of pencils of conics under the action of the projective group $\mathrm{PGL}(3,\mathbf{R})$ ( and $\mathrm{PGL}(3,\mathbf{C})$ ).


## March 31: [**Jacques Pienaar**](https://www.jaypienaar.com): [QBism](http://www.physics.umb.edu/Research/QBism/), an introduction for mathematicians


## March 24: **Bruno Suassuna**: Formal Perturbation Theory for Stochastic Paths
- Short abstract for mathematicians:

We discuss methods of perturbative QFT applied to certain stochastic differential equations (SDE), perturbations of the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. No knowledge of SDE or QFT is assumed.

Perturbative QFT amounts to some sort of generating function for formal power series expansions, and these methods have found many applications in pure and applied mathematics. This is the main motivation for this talk. The lack of mathematical proofs often comes together with the magical formulas derived from these methods, and this will also be examplified in this talk. 

The application we discuss was the subject of joint work with Bruno Melo (ETH Zurich) and Thiago Guerreiro (PUC-RIO), published (PhysRevA) in January 2021.

- Fine-print for physicists:

The motivation comes from experiments with optical tweezers, which roughly are laser beams able to trap certain particles around a point of mechanical equilibrium. The particle does not sit in the mechanical equilibrium, but jiggles stochastically around it; this stochasticity is known as Brownian motion and is the reason one uses SDE instead of ODE in the mathematical models. Often the working assumption is that the optical forces are a linear function of the displacement from mechanical equilibrium, which as we know is simply a first order Taylor approximation. We provided a way to deal with optical forces modelled by a linear function perturbed by small non-linearities, so potentially this method would be useful for sufficiently precise experiments. The validity of our method was probed by some numerical experiments, and for mysterious reasons it seems to work.


## 2022, Dec 16: [**Marcos Craizer**](http://mat.puc-rio.br/~craizer): Esferas Afins Impr√≥prias e Equa√ß√µes de Monge-Amp√®re
Nesta aula vamos falar da rela√ß√£o entre esferas afins impr√≥prias e equa√ß√µes de Monge-Amp√®re. Discutiremos a constru√ß√£o centro-corda para esferas afins impr√≥prias de dimens√£o 2 e as singularidades gen√©ricas destas superf√≠cies. Mostramos tamb√©m uma generaliza√ß√£o desta constru√ß√£o para dimens√µes pares arbitr√°rias.


## 2022, Dec 9: [**Alexander Guterman**](https://math.biu.ac.il/en/node/3469): The solution of Wang-Krauters‚Äôs problem on permanents of (‚àí1, 1)-matrices
Slides of the talk in PDF: <http://www.mat.puc-rio.br/Upload/Arquivo/2022/12/guterman22decrio.pdf>
The classes of $(-1,1)$-matrices are very important in algebra and combinatorics and in various their applications. For example, well-known Hadamard matrices are of this type.  

Two important functions in matrix theory, determinant and permanent, look very similar:
$$\mathrm{det} A = \sum_{\sigma\in \Sigma_n} (-1)^{\sigma} a_{1\sigma(1)}\cdots a_{n\sigma(n)}$$
and
$$\mathrm{per} A = \sum_{\sigma\in \Sigma_n} a_{1\sigma(1)}\cdots a_{n\sigma(n)}$$
here $A=(a_{ij})\in M_n(\mathrm{F})$ is an $n\times n$ matrix and $\Sigma_n$ denotes the set of all permutations of the set $\{1,\ldots, n\}$. 

While the computation of the determinant can be done in a polynomial time, it is still an open question, if there are such algorithms to compute the permanent. 

In 1974 Wang posed a question to find a decent upper bound for $|\mathrm{per}(A)|$ if $A$ is a square $\pm 1$-matrix of rank $k$.
In 1985 Kr√§uter conjectured a certain upper bound. 

We prove the Kr√§uter's conjecture and thus obtain the complete answer to the Wang's question. In particular, we characterized matrices with the maximal possible permanent for each value of $k$.

We also plan to discuss other problems related to permanent for $(0,1)$ and $(-1,1)$-matrices.

The talk is based on the joint work with M.V. Budrevich.
